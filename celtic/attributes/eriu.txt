‘The Harp of Erin’ by Thomas Buchanan Read

The Eriu goddess is the goddess of Ireland itself. She’s the goddess of fertility, abundance and sovereignty, and her name translates to ‘fullness’, ‘bounty’ or ‘abundance’. She was a member of the Tuatha Dé Danann, and is the sister of Banba and Fódla. The trio of sisters were married to three brothers, and it’s said that the three sisters asked that all of their names be given to Ireland. The name ‘Ireland’ is directly taken from Eriu, but Banba and Fódla are sometimes used as poetic names for the country.
