The Celtic goddess Danu is known as the mother of Irish gods. She is the mother goddess of the Tuatha Dé Danann – in fact, these supernatural beings take their name from Danu, as the name Tuatha Dé Danann translates to ‘the peoples of the goddess Danu’. That means that all members of the clan descend from Danu, but despite her importance in Irish mythology, her own origins are unclear.

She is strongly associated with nature, as well as regeneration, wisdom, death, and prosperity. It’s thought that she passed on her own wisdom to members of the Tuatha Dé Danann, as well as her creative and crafty talents.
