Macha the Celtic goddess represents life, death and war – and it’s usually said that she’s one of the Celtic triple goddesses associated with Morrigan. She’s also the goddess of the land, and is commonly associated with horses. 

As the goddess of war, legend has it that Macha would feed on the heads of her enemies after defeating them in battle. As a mother goddess, there are usually three parts associated with Macha: a maternal reproductive element, an agrarian element, and an element of sexual fertility.
