The Celtic goddess Brigid is the goddess of fire, healing, agriculture, prophecy and poetry. It’s said that she was much loved by poets, and she is considered to be a wise sage.

Like Morrigan, she may be a Celtic triple goddess, as it’s sometimes said that she has two sisters, Brigid the healer and Brigid the smith.

Brigid is also a member of the Tuatha Dé Danann. She is the daughter of Dagda, the wife of Bres and the mother of Ruadán.
